They wanted to develop a new platform for independent musicians, where they could streamline their process of creating, publishing, and promoting their songs! They chose me because of my success story at Ivy, a startup where I was working at the time. Leading the development from the first line of code to a multi-million exit, I had everything to drive Indieflow to the same success! Since I was employed at the time, I started developing it during my night shifts and even took all my vacation time. But was all worth it!<br /> Eventually, I had to step down for family reasons, but the company continues to make more innovations in the field!"
